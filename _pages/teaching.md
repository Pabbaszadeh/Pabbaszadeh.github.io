<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">Modern Statistics for Engineers</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This course covers fundamentals of modern statistics and its applications in different engineering disciplines. The focus is on understanding and implementing different statistical concepts and utilizing Python programming to solve real-word problems. These include Probability, Probabilistic Models, Bayesian versus Frequentist Statistics, Density Estimation, Clustering, Classification, Kernel Methods, Gaussian Processes, Optimization, Error Estimation, Markov Processes, Monte Carlo and MCMC Inference.<br><br>

<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">Applied Probability and Statistics in CEE</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This course covers the fundamental concepts of probability and statistics. Topics include descriptive statistics for summarizing and visualizing data, probability theory including basic concepts and distributions, analysis of discrete and continuous random variables, joint distributions, sampling techniques, regression analysis, correlation, goodness-of-fit tests, and nonparametric methods. Throughout this course, I prioritize real-world applications, ensuring students develop practical problem-solving skills essential for success in all CEE disciplines.<br>

<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">Water Resources Engineering</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This course covers the fundamental physics governing water movement across the land surface and subsurface. Topics include the hydrologic cycle, precipitation measurement and analysis, and key land surface processes such as evaporation, evapotranspiration, infiltration, and surface runoff. Emphasis is placed on the physical principles and governing equations for quantifying these processes, including energy balance and mass transfer approaches for evaporation, empirical and physically based models for infiltration (Horton and Green-Ampt models), and rainfall-runoff relationships using hydrograph analysis. The course also covers groundwater flow principles, Darcyâ€™s Law, aquifer storage, and reservoir water balance. Real-world applications focus on predicting water availability, designing sustainable water management systems, and solving engineering problems related to flooding, drought, and urban water demand.<br>
